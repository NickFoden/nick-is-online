        <h1> About Nick</h1>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello! Nick is a web developer mostly using a modified MEAN stack of Mongo, Express, React
            and Node to write full stack web apps suplemented with some other tech and tools. Firebase, Redux, Graphql to
            name a few. The list is constanty expanding and changing. He is really looking forward to some React-Native and
            Electron projects in near future as well.
        </p>
        <button id="expand-bio">Longer Expanded Bio ?</button>
        <div id="bio-long" class="hide">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nick was born and raised in Mountain View, California, by tech oriented parents - an
                Oracle DB manager and a Marketing Director, so being computer literate was and has always been a part of
                his life. After attending college in San Francisco, with an interest in psychology and film, Nick moved to
                NY to be closer to family. He soon found a job with an Architecture firm and absorbed more and more of their
                IT and Accounting workload, enabling the firm to let go of IT contracts and consolidate the firm's backend
                needs.
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 2015, Nick was getting tired of consuming so many websites and apps and kept seeing
                the limitations or places where he wanted to tweak the app. Some times a small part of the design or other
                times add more robust features or even totally redo the app entirely. He really wanted to start creating
                and contributing, so he started to take MOOC's and follow various tutorials working mainly with Python and
                Ruby, and then end of 2016 decided to take a bigger step, kick this thing into gear for real. And so he worked
                through a javascript bootcamp program where he was paired with a senior developer as a mentor. After completing
                the curriculum Nick has taken on side projects building Web Apps with React-Redux and following client requests
                using mostlty Firebase backends, and while firebase is easy to get off the ground and it makes sense for
                most applications, he looks forward to building the entire app front to back and using more node and mongodb
                in the future as well.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nick isn't at home javascripting away, you can find him rescuing animals with
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unwantecnycpets/" target="_blank">Unwanted NYC Pets</a>, walking his dog around Brooklyn, cycling or running around NYC, upstate NY hiking
                with his dog or
                <a href="https://kirieelite32.com/" target="_blank">sailing in Gardiners Bay </a>.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nick would love to hear from you,

                        The other Die Hard films are ok, but decided to focus on the 3 greatest films of all time. I'd like
                        to go back and add some more questions for the real Die Hard maniacs and screen cap some of the scenes
                        into gifs with the nifty
                        <a href="https://gyazo.com/about" target="_blank">Gyazo</a> tool and then use those to supplement the questions giving you a an exact moment to jog
                        your memory. Although this would have to be on the easy setting that will be added. Also want to
                        make a Striking Distance quiz, but not sure how many fans will know that one in and out.
